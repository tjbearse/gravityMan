gravityMan
==========

GravityMan is a project under development by T.J. Bearse and Heather Gonring. GravityMan is the working title for a game in which the player controls the global gravity and must move to the end goal using a grappling hook to move and manipulate the game world. In order to make GravityMan we are currently constructing a 2D physics engine. The game that is currently implemented serves as a sandbox for testing the engine as we implement it.

Currently the engine renders objects of a single color but texture support is planned. We have also implemented many of the physical phenomenon with the exception of collision response and the corresponding friction forces.

Development progress will be slow during the school season due to required class projects but we hope to make periodic commits to this repo to keep the project going.
