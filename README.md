gravityMan
==========

GravityMan is a project under development by T.J. Bearse and Heather Gonring. GravityMan is the working title for a game in which the player controls the global gravity and must move to the end goal using a grappling hook to move and manipulate the game world. In order to make GravityMan we are currently constructing a 2D physics engine. The game that is currently implemented serves as a sandbox for testing the engine as we implement it.
