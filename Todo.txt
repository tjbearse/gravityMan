Todo:
	Physics Engine
		Clean structure
			Entities
				is movablefixed necessarry?
				are there any non-AbstractFreeMovableEntity classes
			Get rid of unused classes
			Reorganize packages
		Collision detection
			make quadtree for collision detection [Heather]
				find nice numbers
			Fix redundant vector function in SAT class (removing too many vectors?) [Heather]
		Collision handling
			Impulse or force based?
		Rigid Body Chaining
			system for fixed pivots for rigid bodies
			system for resolving the forces on a chain of rigid bodies
		Motors [Heather & TJ]
			(method of creating moving platforms)
			(method of moving player also?)
		Encapsulate physics engine?
			move logic (i.e. gravity, collisions, friction, direct input to forces) to physics engine class
			make interface for the game to control engine
				add items
				motors for controlling objects, gravity
				how to handle special collisions? (e.g. endzone, hazard contact, etc)
					call back function to game
					overriden collision handle operators
					modify state/flag vaiables
		Drawing
			z-indexing / layering
	Game play
		Game loop
			step back from constructor only approach?
		Levels
			design content
			load/store procedures
		Objects
			Rope
				rope throwing
					cross hairs
				rope attachment
				rope attachability
			gravity man class
			more platform shapes
			hazards
		Visual
			Add color/texture support for objects [Heather & TJ]
				store only style and keep data outside of class?
				store inside class?
			Object color effects
				alpha / tranparency
			background
				how to manipulate
			hud/gui design [Heather & TJ]
				gravity vector 
				cross hairs
				menus, menu buttons
		Controls
			savable key mappings
				how to load/store
			gravity vector
			cross hair move
			rope shoot
			rope disconnect
